A list will be returned that contains three elements. The content, the url and the response
received from the api.

The content is probably the most useful part for the user since it is a data.frame containing the
information about the DotaTV-supported leagues. It consists of the five following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{name:} The league name.
  \item \strong{leagueid:} The ID of the league (unique).
  \item \strong{description:} A description containing information about the league.
  \item \strong{tournament_url:} The website of the link.
  \item \strong{itemdef:} Not documented on the API.
